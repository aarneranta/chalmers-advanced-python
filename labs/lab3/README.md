# Lab 3: A web application for the tram network

Advanced Python Course, Chalmers DAT690 / DIT516 / DAT516, 2025

by Aarne Ranta & John J. Camilleri

## Purpose

The purpose of this lab is to build a web application replicating some functionalities of apps such as [Västtrafik's Travel Planner](https://www.vasttrafik.se/reseplanering/reseplaneraren/).
Your application will:

- display the complete map of tram lines
- highlight shortest paths in terms of time and geographical distance
- calculate total travel time by taking changes into account
- show actual departures from any stop by clicking on it

Here is an example screenshot:

![shortest-path](../app-shortest.png)

In some more detail, here is what the three different screens should look like:

- [home screen](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/aarneranta/chalmers-advanced-python/blob/main/labs/lab3/examples/home.html)
- [route search form](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/aarneranta/chalmers-advanced-python/blob/main/labs/lab3/examples/find_route.html)
- [search result](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/aarneranta/chalmers-advanced-python/blob/main/labs/lab3/examples/show_route.html)

Unlike the official app, ours will not have access to the actual timetables, but just to the distances and times as defined in Labs 1 and 2.
This is of course a severe simplification — but, on the other hand,
our app will be usable for any transport system that can be
represented by the class `TramNetwork`.
Clicking on the created map will give access to actual traffic information from Västtrafik.

Another difference from the official app is that we only run ours in a safe `localhost` environment.
Thereby we do not have to deal with security issues, and it will also be much easier for all groups to finish the project.

The learning outcomes include:

- visualization with more details on positions and colours
- simple front-end construction with HTML
- putting everything together by using a web application framework, Django
- more details of `graphviz` library, various libraries belonging to the Django framework
- virtual environments, the `venv` module

## Getting started

We will follow the standard worklow for the Django framework.
There are several tutorials available, for instance:

- [Official Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/intro/tutorial01/)
- [Django Girls Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/)
- [w3schools Django Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/django/)

You can look at these for more information, but this document is aimed to be self-contained and sufficient for the lab.

### Directory structure

For this lab, we will start from a blank slate and build up the project's directory structure step-by-step.
The final structure will look as follows.
The files are obtained as follows:

- copied from [`files`](./files/) in this repository (marked 🔵)
- created automatically by Django (unmarked in the diagram)
- slightly modified from automatic files (marked 🟡)
- explained in detail but written by you (marked 🟠)
- written by you (marked 🔴)
- generated by your code (marked ⚪️)

```

### Create Django project

Now we will prepare our environment, install the Django library, and initialize our Django project.

1. Create a directory for this project (not the same as in course GitHub):

    ```sh
    $ mkdir lab3
    ```

2. Move inside it:

    ```sh
    $ cd lab3
    ```

3. Create a Python virtual environment (maybe not necessary, but the best practice):

    ```sh
    $ python3 -m venv myvenv
    ```

    This will create the directory `myvenv` with lots of things in it, but you don't need to concern yourselves with its contents.
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - on Linux/Mac:

      ```sh
      $ source myvenv/bin/activate
      ```

    - on Windows:

      ```sh
      $ myvenv/Scripts/activate.bat
      ```

      or

      ```sh
      $ myvenv/Scripts/activate.ps1
      ```

      Which of these two commands will work depends on what shell you are using. If unsure, try both.
  
    You should now see the string `(myvenv)` prefixed to your command line prompt.
5. Install the necessary Python libraries into the virtual environment:

    ```sh
    (myvenv) $ pip install django==5.2.7
    (myvenv) $ pip install networkx 
    ```

6. Create a new Django project with:

    ```sh
    (myvenv) $ django-admin startproject mysite .
    ```

    (the last dot `.` is necessary: it refers to your working directory, where it creates a directory named
  `mysite` and the file `manage.py`).

At later times (every time you resume working on the project), only the `activate` step (4) is needed.

<!--
### Change default settings

In the generated `mysite/settings.py`, you need to change `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to:

```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1']
```

In order to serve certain files directly, add this to the end of your settings file:

```python
STATICFILES_DIRS = ['./static']
```

Then make sure the `static` directory exists (creating it if needed) and copy the file `tramnetwork.json` created in Lab 1 into this directory.
-->

### Initialize database

This step is needed at the first time:

```sh
$ python manage.py migrate
```

It creates a database (in the file `db.sqlite3`), which is a standard part of any Django project, even if we don't need it very much at this lab.

### Run web server

Now we can start the web server with:

```sh
$ python manage.py runserver
...
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
...
```

Open the URL above in a web browser to check if the installation succeeded.
You should see a generic Django-generated page, which tells you one important thing: that your server is up and running.

## Create the tram app

Now that we have a basic Django server up and running, it's time to start customising it for our task. For this we will create a Django "app" with the name `tram`:

```sh
$ python manage.py startapp tram
```

This creates the directory `tram`, with a lot of predefined contents, but also many things that you will have to complete with your own code.

To recognize this file in your Django website, add the line:

```python
'tram.apps.TramConfig',
```

to the end of the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `mysite/settings.py`.

### Create a model

Create a data model for route searches in `tram/models.py`:

```python
from django.db import models

class Route(models.Model):
    dep = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    dest = models.CharField(max_length=200)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.dep + '-' + self.dest
```

Then migrate it to the database:

```sh
$ python manage.py makemigrations tram
$ python manage.py migrate tram
```

You will see that your `db.sqlite3` file has contents now, but they are in a binary format that you cannot read.

**Note:** In this lab, the application does not add data to the database, but its schema (the `Route` class) is used to structure the queries made via the route search forms.
This is known as the _MVT Design Pattern_ (Model-View-Template):

- a **model** (in `tram/models.py`) is a class that defines a type of data
- a **view** (to be added to `tram/views.py`) is a function that processes a user request and returns a template
- a **template** (to be added to `tram/templates/tram`) is an HTML file that shows the data

The database could also be manipulated in the _SQL_ language, but Django generates SQL from Python, so that you don't need to learn SQL itself.

### Update URL search patterns

Edit the generated `mysite/urls.py` so that it contains the following:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('tram.urls')),
]
```

The `admin` URL is used for managing the website and requires a login. You can try and create users and passwords, but this is not needed in this lab.
The second `path` includes the URLs given in our app.
For this purpose, you have to create the file `tram/urls.py`:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.tram_net, name='home'),
    path('route/', views.find_route, name='find_route'),
]
```

Each path has three arguments:

- the path extending the hostname (seen in the URL field of the browser)
- the "view", i.e. the function called when this URL is requested
- the name of the template file (without the extension `.html`)

### Create views

In order for `tram/urls.py` to work, you have to edit `tram/views.py`, so that it contains the following:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .forms import RouteForm

def tram_net(request):
    return render(request, 'tram/home.html', {})

def find_route(request):
    form = RouteForm()
    return render(request, 'tram/find_route.html', {'form': form})
```

The former function is already all we need to create the start page.
The latter function creates a web form, but does not yet do anything with it: we will return to this later.

Of course, we also need to define the `RouteForm` class and the HTML files.
This is the next topic.

### Create a form

In order for `tram/views.py` to work, we need to create `tram/forms.py`:

```python
from django import forms
from .models import Route

class RouteForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Route
        fields = ('dep', 'dest',)
```

The data model is used here to give a structure to the web form where route queries are made.

### Create templates

The HTML files to be created are actually **templates**, since they contain slots where dynamic data is inserted by the server.
The templates reside in a sub-sub-sub-directory, which has to be created first:

```sh
$ mkdir tram/templates
$ mkdir tram/templates/tram
```

Copy the HTML files mentioned in `tram/views.py` from the [`files`](./files/) folder to the newly created `tram/templates/tram`, so that:

```sh
$ ls tram/templates/tram/
find_route.html    home.html   show_route.html
```

### Create template images

Also create the `images` subdirectory:

```sh
$ mkdir tram/templates/tram/images
```

and copy the tram network image [`gbg_tramnet.svg`](./files/gbg_tramnet.svg) into it. Note that images in this folder can be used in templates (e.g. `home.html`) but are _not_ served publicly by the web server; i.e. you _cannot_ access it via a web browser using something like `http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/gbg_tramnet.svg`.

Now [run the web server](#run-web-server) again. You will see a home screen with the gorgeous SVG image of Gothenburg tram network.

If you want, you can replace this standard image with your own one: the script [`create_network_picture.py`](./files/create_network_picture.py) does this for you by calling your own `tram.py` on your own `tramnet.json` file.
You can also try to make the picture nicer by changing positioning and other parameters.
But before doing this, make sure to implement the rest of the basic functionalities!

You can return to image generation in the task where you are expected to change the URLs in the tram stops.
Right now, when you click at them, you should be taken to a Google search about that stop.

### Render dynamic content

The form `find_route.html` does not find any routes yet.
You can submit queries, but when you press "Search", the form just becomes empty without any result being produced.

So now we want to add some basic functionality that actually shows the shortest path.
The following things are needed:

- a "utility" function that actually calculates the shortest path (from Lab 2)
- an extended `find_route()` function in `tram/views.py` (to be copied from [`files/views.py`](./files/views.py))
- a template that shows the route that is found (already copied above)

#### Add utility functions

It is a good practice to create a separate directory for "non-Django" utility functions and create an empty `__init__.py` file in it, so that it is recognized as a package.

```sh
$ mkdir tram/utils
$ touch tram/utils/__init__.py
```

Copy the following Python files from [`files`](./files/) into `tram/utils`:

- `graphs.py`, a mock-up, for the most part to be replaced by your Lab 2 version
- `trams.py`, a mock-up, for the most part to be replaced by your Lab 2 version
- `tramviz.py`, finding the shortest paths and marking them in SVG; for you TODO
- `color_tram_svg.py`, actually making the colouring in SVG, no need for you to touch

#### Update views

Now that you have created the utility files, you can replace the simplified `tram/views.py` with the one given in [`files`](./files/views.py).

Now you can visit <http://127.0.0.1:8000/route/>, submit a query and get a response (although this is just using a dummr implementation for now).

## Your TODO: continue from here

Now it is "just" your part of the work that remains.
Most of this work is to be done in the files in `tram/utils`.
They contain `TODO` comments that instruct you what to do.

The main function in the file `tram/utils/tramviz.py`, imported in `tram/views.py`, is `show_shortest`.
Its task is to:

- find the shortest paths
- use them to colour the network picture
- show them in strings returned to `tram/views.py`

As the example for the [search result](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/aarneranta/chalmers-advanced-python/blob/main/labs/lab3/examples/show_route.html) page shows, we expect three different colours to be used:

- green for stops on the shortest path
- orange for stops on quickest path
- cyan for stops that are on both paths

You can also use some other colours if you prefer.
Other stops should be left white.

The default implementation copied from [`files/tramviz.py`](./files/tramviz.py) is a mock-up, which always shows the same colours and the same route.

You can of course also makes the HTML files look nicer if you have time!

### Add changes of lines

In Lab 2 shortest path, we ignored the effect of changing from one line to the other.
This effect is a major factor that can make the "shortest time" and "shortest distance" differ significantly.
Its implementation requires that we recognize when a change must be made and add a suitable number of minutes or meters to the cost.

One way to do this with the existing algorithms is simply to build a new graph for the network, where:

- vertices are pairs `(stop, line)` for each `stop` in the original graph and each `line` than passes through it
- every edge `(a, b)` of the original graph is multiplied to edges `((a, line), (b, line))` for every `line` that serves both `a` and `b`
- edges are added between all vertices that have the same `stop`
- distances and transfer time between different stops are the same as in the original graph
- a special change distance and change time is added between vertices that have the same stop but different times, e.g. 20 metres and 10 minutes respectively

### Add links to actual traffic information

TODO: Some intro text here

The challenge is to find the URLs corresponding to each stop name.
They are given as numerical codes, for instance, Nordstan is:

```plain
https://www.vasttrafik.se/reseplanering/hallplatser/9021014004945000/
```

and its timetable is in:

```plain
https://avgangstavla.vasttrafik.se/?stopAreaGid=9021014004945000
```

The full list of stop identifiers can be found at
<https://www.vasttrafik.se/reseplanering/hallplatslista/>.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Investigate where and how Gids are given in the HTML document.
2. Extract the Gids of all tram stops from the document.
3. Create URLs for every stop.
4. Save the stop-URL dictionary as a JSON file

For step 2, you can use the [standard library for parsing HTML](https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.html).
A slightly more convenient third party library which can be used for this is [Beatiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).

After this, you need to update the SVG image by these URLs.
The simplest way to do this is as follows:

1. Run [`files/create_network_picture.py`](files/create_network_picture.py) making sure that `TRAM_URL_FILE` and `MY_TRAMNETWORK_JSON` point to your URL dictionary and tramnetwork file, respectively.
2. Move the resulting file `my_gbg_tramnet.svg` to `tram/templates/tram/images/gbg_tramnet.svg`

Another possibility is to process the file `gbg_tramnet.svg` directly, which you can do with [`files/change_urls.py`](files/change_urls.py).
<!--
You can do this by following the model of `tram/utils/color_tram_svg.py`.
-->

Both methods should be applied outside your project environment, directly in `files` and only once.
Hence there is no need to copy those Python files from `files` to `tram/utils` or any such place.

After doing this, make another search in your web application and click at some stop to verify that the link has been updated.

## Submission

TODO

Via [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/hnF26g57) as usual.

You should use `.gitignore` in order to avoid committing the virtual environment directory (`myvenv`) to the repository.

Before inspecting your code, we will organize peer reviewing sessions, where each group tests and reviews some other group's lab.
The review report that you write will be added as a part of your submission.
[More details about peer reviewing](./peer-review.md).
