# Points from labs and their parts

Advanced Python Course, Chalmers DAT515, 2021

by Aarne Ranta


The following table shows how many points can be gained from each lab:

| Lab   | Basic part | Bonus 1 | Bonus 2 |
| ---   | ---------- | ------- | ------- |
| Lab 1 | 10         | 2       | -       |
| Lab 2 | 10         | 4       | -       |
| Lab 3 | 10         | 4       | 4       |
| extra-colouring  | 6         | 4       | -     |
| extra-clustering | 6         | -       | -     |

The minimum points for different grades are:

- grade 3: 30, consisting of the basic parts of Labs 1,2,3
- grade 4: 40, must include all basic parts of Labs 1,2,3
- grade 5: 50, must include all basic parts of Labs 1,2,3

Thus there is only one way to gain grade 3, but several ways for the higher grades.

In addition to the labs, you will have to pass the exam.
But the exam does not affect your final grade.

Since the exam is individual, it is possible that one member or a group is passed but another one failed.
Failed students can, as usual, take a re-exam later without resubmitting their labs.
